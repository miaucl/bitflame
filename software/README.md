# SOFTWARE

The microcontroller used for this project is an _Arduino MICRO_.

## Setup

To build, flash and execute the code, use the standard Arduino IDE.

###Â Dependencies

First of all install following libraries:

* `Adafruit_DRV2065_Library@v1.1.1`: This library is used to control the driver for the vibration motor via I2C
* `Adafruit_VL53L0X_Library@v1.1.0`: This library is used to control the time-of-flight for distance measurement via I2C

_Install all recommended libraries, should the IDE ask to you for it._


### Test your components

To test the individual components, use the example scripts provided along with the libraries.
