# bitflame

Bitflame has two parts, a simulation written in _python_ `.ipynb` to proof the concept, test and generate _GIFs_. The second part is a `C++` implementation targeting the _Arduino_ platform. It is available as _Arduino Library_ and can be imported into any project. It is a pure software library and can be adapted to any display as demonstrated in the `examples`.
